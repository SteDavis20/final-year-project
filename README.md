## Purpose

The purpose of this application is to apply gamification frameworks to a social mobile application, aiming to motivate pro-environmental behavioural change and thus reduce individual carbon footprints.

## Running the Application

Prior to running the application, you will need to have setup and installed an iOS or an Android emulator. iOS emulators are set up through XCode, and Android emulators are setup through Android Studio.

Once you have the emulators set up, clone the repository and navigate into the fyp_app folder. From here, run the application using expo. To accomplish these steps, type the following commands into the terminal after cloning the repository:

- cd fyp_app
- npm install
- npm start
- i (to run iPhone simulator) or
- a (to run Android simulator)
